2010-08-05

<a href="http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/">Archcon 2010</a> was an Arch Linux conference in Toronto, Canada last week.

Next to my Arch duties I also gave a talk about Uzbl.  Basically I took the <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/fosdem2010">Uzbl lightningtalk at Fosdem</a>
and:
<ul>
<li>took more time to go into some details</li>
<li>added a section about other interestping browsers</li>
<li>discussed the current limitations and roadmap</li>
</ul>
