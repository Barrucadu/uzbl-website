More goodies

2009-05-26

The uzbl project is now just over one month old.  To celebrate that we bring you the following goodies in the master branch:

- sample script "form filler". aids in creating and running per-domain configs for auto-filling of html form values. ( eg "remember password" but more flexible)
- various more things to tune (`autoload_images`, `enable_spellcheck`, `disable_scripts`, `resizeable_text_areas`, `default_encoding` and more)
- <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/wiki/html-mode">Html mode</a> so you can "`use | uzbl | like this`" and do really fancy things.
- Webkit inspector
- loading of JS in files
- slightly improved command syntax (see example configs)
- bugfixes and many small improvements (suprise !)
- better documentation

As usual, don't have too high expectations.  We are not even alpha yet...
We've seen again great interest and input from many people.  Thanks a lot guys and girls.
