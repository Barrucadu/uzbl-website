2009.10.: A huge makeover.  The second phase in the life of uzbl

2009-10-

For the last two months, Rob and Mason have been doing truly awesome work
giving uzbl a makeover and today, all those changes should be ready for
wider consumption.

Hilights:
- splitup and better separation of concerns: uzbl-core, uzbl-browser and uzbl-tabbed.
  Basically, uzbl-core is the old uzbl, minus the built-in event handling,
  and minus the keyboard interface.
  Uzbl-browser is a complete, "working out of the box" browser
  implementation based on uzbl-core and many of the scripts we already a
  knew.  but also some more things.. (read on)
  Uzbl-tabbed is the old uzbl-tabbed, but refactored to work with the new
  uzbl-browser.
  For more information, refer to the readme.
  
- EM instead of handlers : very finegrained, language agnostic
much better keybinds (special keys, everything configurable, better Modkeys
many improvements in other areas
- ...
- the website and docs have also had an overhaul to reflect these changes
