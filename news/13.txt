2009.08.08: fast cookies (WIP), custom variables, default font_families and more

2009-08-08

- talk_to_socket command: yeah baby this is it.  With this thing you can
  have handlers running in the background listening on a socket.  You can
  use this for fast communication with handlers instead of respawning them
  all the time. You can try <a href="http://www.lwithers.me.uk/usr/src/cookie-handler/">lwithers' cookie handler </a>
  but some people are also working on a python one.
  Note that the current example config still uses the slower
  <strong>spawn</strong> command!
  We will improve this in the future to ship a socket based handler and use
  talk_to_socket by default.
- removed html_mode in favor of "data URI scheme"
- custom variables: you can now set your own variables in your scripts and
  config file and use them whereever you want.
- setting of default font_families.
- uzbl_tabbed.py:
  * on the fly session saving and loading
  * cleanup itself after being SIGTERM'd or SIGINT'd from the terminal
  * re-factored fifo code
