50 years of humans in space! Not really that long, when you think about it.

So, what's new with uzbl?

- new example bindings:
  - `<Ctrl>p` makes a hardcopy of a page
  - `gw` opens a new window (even when the `NEW_WINDOW` event is configured to
    open a tab)
  - `zs` switches from http to https in the current window
  - `zS` switches from http to https in a new window
- big improvements to the keyboard link follower:
  - following links within frames
  - activating `onclick` elements
  - prettification
- improved example download handler
- uzbl-tabbed:
  - `--socketdir` and `--fifodir` arguments

And of course various bugfixes.

Many thanks to everybody who contributed!
