2012.05.14: World Naked Gardening Day

2012-05-19

This release is mostly fixes for bugs.

 * copy and paste behaves less strangely
 * fancy textareas perform better
 * by default Uzbl passes multiple clicks through to Webkit; there's a
  `handle_multi_click` variable that can be set so that you can do your own
  handling
 * cookies.txt is now created `chmod o-r` so that other users on your system
  cannot access it. (Existing cookie files will have their permissions changed.)
 * the `back` and `forward` commands can now take a numeric argument to go back
   or forward multiple steps

In the development version we've rewritten the event manager in Python 3 and
exposed more Webkit functionality.
