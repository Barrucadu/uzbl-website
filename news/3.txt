Some updates

2009-05-08

Various things have been improved/added recently.  Here are the main ones. 
I may have forgotten some.

- Keyboard based link following (uses link numbering for now)
- Customizable statusbar (both in what it shows, and in colors)
- Network settings (max connections, proxy, user agent (with variable replacement))
- Searching
- multichar key bindings
- bindings that can use arguments (other browsers call this "keywords")

You can find these new goodies in the master and experimental branches.
Don't forget to have a good look at the sample configs and scripts, and the
docs.

Thanks to all contributors!

We also have a logo now, thanks Thorsten Wilms!

TODO:
- some sort of "multiple instances management" (Not saying tabs)
