2011.02.15: Too long between releases!

2010-02-15

Wow, it's already been 3 months since the last release? That's too long.

I've been dreading this release, because it breaks backwards compatibility. In
short:

* the way downloads are handled has changed
* `$UZBL_FIFO`, `$UZBL_TITLE` are available to scripts as environment
  variables, but not as command-line arguments.
* `$ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES` are no longer expanded by the config parser
* cookie daemons are no longer supported

The <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/wiki/experimental-branch">full details are
on the wiki</a>, including how to get your browser working again.

The good news is:

* downloads will work on sites that they didn't before
* it's easier to write and understand scripts
* uzbl parses commands faster and more consistently
* uzbl can make requests immediately rather than waiting for a response from
  an external cookie handler

Besides these changes and various cleanup and bugfixes, we have:

* a per-site-settings script that executes commands from a config file based
  on the current URL
* powerful cookie whitelisting and blacklisting
* gtk3 support (we build against gtk2 by default, enabling gtk3 requires
  uncommenting some lines in the Makefile)
* the `accept_languages` variable, which controls the `Accept-Language` HTTP
  header
* a split statusbar that allows right-aligned content

This release was brought to you by Ben Boeckel, k0ral, David Keijser, Jochen
Sprickerhof, and myself. (I'm the one to blame for the compatibility changes.)
