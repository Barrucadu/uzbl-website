Segfaults with WebkitGtk 1.1.15.3

2009-10-24

Are you getting segfaults since you upgraded your libwebkit?
Try downgrading it to 1.1.15.2 or earlier.
The WebkitGtk guys told me they will do a bugfix release, but we impatient Arch users
can check:

- /var/cache/pacman/pkg/libwebkit-1.1.1*
- the (unofficial) <a href="http://arm.kh.nu/">Arch Rollback Machine</a>

Btw: we're also preparing a new Uzbl release, based on the huge improvements
Rob and Mason have been doing (much better command interface/key handling/events/refactorings/..)
If you want to get a sneak preview, try out the <a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/tree/experimental">experimental</a> tree.
