More updates

2009-05-17

The master branch is again in sync with the experimental one and brings you these features:

- overhauled the config system. no more ini-files.  We now use files with commands in the same syntax as what you write to the fifo/pipes etc.
- Entire configuration can be altered at runtime.
- more advanced binding and command parsing options (see sample config)
- support for dmenu-vertical (see screenshot).  The sample scripts allow you to also search in page titles, bookmark tags etc if you have dmenu-vertical installed
- customizable window title
- massive documentation updates, which are also reflected on the website
- and quite a lot smaller fixes, additions and sample scripts...

As usual, plenty of people have been contributing to uzbl, and we keep welcoming new people.
See the AUTHORS file for details.
Thanks all!
