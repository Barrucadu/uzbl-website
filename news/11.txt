Cool new stuff.  First release.  And a nice community contribution...

2009-07-03

Hi.  I intend to make the lives of downstream packagers a little easier so I
will call my master tags "releases" and provide links to tarballs.
Expect a new release every few weeks or so.

So here is the first uzbl alpha release, version 2009.07.03
- <a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/tree/2009.07.03">tree</a>
- <a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/tarball/2009.07.03">tgz</a>

This version brings:
- A JS object to execute commands (be sure to read the security implications in the readme)
- config file changes: command substitution, variable expansion, javascript substitution
- bidirectional socket (responses come back through the socket now)
- reading config from stdin is optional now (so you can background uzbl)
- Makefile compat fix, typos, cookies.py XDG paths bugfix and more small stuff

For people with crappy window managers or on platforms
over which they have very little control (*cough* you know who you are),
lazy ones or just those who haven't seen the light yet,
there is more good news:
Some people in the community have taken it on them to improve
uzbl_tabbed.py.. a lot! (uzbl_tabbed.py was the proof of concept script
introduced 2 weeks ago to demonstrate the Xembed functionality)
While it is quite new, I must say it is starting to look quite nice (and
configurable).
It's not for everyone, but I think some people will really like it.
You'll find this updated version in the example scripts directory.
