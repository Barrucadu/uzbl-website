Xembed, more useful sample configs/scripts and more.

2009-06-20

Master branch now contains/supports:
- Gtk Plug/Socket (Xembed), comes with sample python script for tabbing uzbl
- a simpler way to play/test/develop/use for real:
  The same config file and set of scripts can now used for all situations, by just overriding the XDG variables.
- patches for building on some different *nixes (BSD,OSX)
- bugfix for segfault on multibyte backspacing.
- Gtk icon.
- Zoom type toggle (full content vs only text)

There is a lot of stuff pending to be merged in experimental as well
(javascript/greasemonkey/DOM exposure/full duplex socket/uzbl config language features,..), so stay tuned!

As usual, thanks to all <a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/blob/master/AUTHORS">contributors</a>.
The list just keeps growing and growing.
