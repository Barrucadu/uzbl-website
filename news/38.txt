2011.10.01: Release early, release occasionally

2011-10-01

Not many new features this time, just a slew of bugfixes and bunch of
refactoring.

- **breaking change**: the variables `disable_plugins` and `disable_scripts`
  have been replaced by `enable_plugins` and `enable_scripts`, for more
  consistency in variable naming.
- added events for double and triple clicks
- added a `spellcheck_languages` variable.
- on some systems windows and tabs took a long time to close, this has been
  fixed.
