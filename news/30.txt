New maintainer

2010-11-21

Hi,
as of today Brendan Taylor (aka 'bct') will be the new uzbl maintainer / project leader.

Uzbl started about a year and a half ago as an experiment, an attempt to make web browsing more bearable for hackers.
We didn't always make the right choices, but at the very least it has been an interesting journey.
I think we've done innovative things.  Uzbl (and browsers in general) still have a way to go, but at least the browsing experience is now tolerable.
Partly because of our work on uzbl, partly because of some other cool browser projects that have appeared since.

Personally I've lost of interest in devoting much of my spare time on Uzbl. 
I have other projects going on (open source stuff, and real life projects), and
I want to be more a user, less a coder.

There are various foss projects where progress goes slowly - releases taking easily a year or more - but that's not how I want it to be for Uzbl.
Uzbl has clearly an active user/contributor base and it's sad to see to the pile of pending patches / pull requests just getting bigger and bigger.
In the spirit of "release early, release often" I think the project also needs somebody who can at least keep up with, and preferrably, drive the progress.
There's still so much innovation which can be done, and now I feel I'm holding it back.

Brendan has been a long time contributor, he seems to know what he's doing, and he has some things he wants to tackle,
so I'll think he's the right person for the job.
He'll share his plans with you guys shortly.

Practically, to keep things simple, the repositories stay the same.
That is:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl">http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl-website">http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl-website</a></li>
</ul>
Brendan will be the guy deciding what goes in and what doesn't.
He'll be the one deciding over your pull requests and patches (but again: community feedback is always welcome!)
He'll also be the one defining the direction of the project, and he's in charge of the website/wiki/bugtracker/...
(although we of course all pitch in where we can, right ;-)

So, welcome Brendan!

Dieter
