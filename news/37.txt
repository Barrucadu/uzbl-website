2011.07.25: Scrollbars have defeated us

2011-07-25

A quick bugfix: the `scrollbars_visible` option is completely gone. It didn't
work at all with GTK3 builds, and [a discussion on the Webkit-GTK mailing list][wkgtk-discussion]
made it apparent that the method we were using was never intended to work.

Besides, there's a better way: you can [use GTK's theming capabilities to turn
scrollbars off, or style them to be less offensive][hide-with-theming].
