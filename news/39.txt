We've added a `toggle` command that cycles a variable through a list of values:

    # you can give the command a list of values to toggle between
    # this keybinding will enable/disable a proxy
    @cbind -pr = toggle proxy_url 'http://localhost:8123/' ''

    # if you have several proxies you could cycle between them by passing more
    # urls to the command.

    # numeric variables default to toggling between 0 and 1.
    # this keybinding will turn the status bar on/off.
    #   (the toggle_status command still exists, but is deprecated)
    @cbind  t   = toggle show_status

Uzbl can now do very basic SSL verification. Two new variables have been added:
`ssl_verify` tells uzbl whether to check SSL certificates, and `ssl_ca_file`
tells uzbl which certificate authority (CA) certificates to verify against.

**Note**: `ssl_ca_file` needs to be correctly set for any verification to be
performed!

The UI for an SSL verification failure is really awful, it just pops up a rather
confusing error message. I wanted to do much more with this, but at this point
it's just better to have anything.

A new mode has been added to the scroll command, you can scroll to an absolute
location.

    # scrolls to 50 pixels from the top of the page
    scroll vertical 50!

The default home page has some advice on what to do once you've got uzbl
installed, and I've added a [keybinding cheat sheet](http://uzbl.org/keybindings.php)
to the website.

We have big plans in the works for the next few months. A major refactor of the
event manager has been completed (it would have been in this release but I need
to put more thought into the installation process). And the massive task that
I've been dreading - a complete rewrite of the command language - is well underway.
