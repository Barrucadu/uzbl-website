2011.07.17: Time Keeps on Slipping

2011-07-17

**Update**: There's a window sizing bug in this release. We're deciding on a
solution, until then you can work around it by adding `set
scrollbars_visible = 1` to the bottom of your config file.

Well hello again! It's been a few months since the last time we talked. Since
then, uzbl has gained:

- a `download` command that triggers a download (this is useful because it can
  use the cookies and authorization details that are available to webkit)
- a script for saving URLs to read later has been added to the example configuration.
  `<Ctrl>d` adds a URL to the list, and `D` loads a URL from it.
- some uses of X properties. Uzbl now sets an `UZBL_URI` X property on its windows,
  and a `window_role` variable is available to set the `WM_WINDOW_ROLE`
  property. Some window managers can use these properties to treat different
  Uzbl windows differently.
- the `scrollbars_visible` option has been removed when Uzbl is built with
  GTK3. Scrollbars can be hidden [using GTK's styling capabilities](http://uzbl.org/wiki/hide-scrollbars). 
- we now automatically build a GTK3 version if possible.

And various bugfixes (window resizing on some window managers, opening paths
on the local filesystem, etc.).
