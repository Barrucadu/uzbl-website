2011.03.14: Happy Pi Day

2010-03-14

Today's release brings you:

* a command history event manager plugin. Default bindings are `<Up>` and
  `<Down>` for browsing recent commands, and `<Ctrl>r` for searching through
  the command history.
* an updated (much more readable) formfiller script. Unfortunately the new
  formfiller uses a different data syntax, so any saved data remaining from
  the old formfiller won't work.
* improved vim syntax highlighting
* a `current_encoding` variable that lets you force the current page to be
  interpreted with a certain text encoding.
* support for cookie daemons (deprecated in the last release) has been removed.

And of course various bugfixes.

Many thanks to this month's team: Taylan Ulrich Bayırlı, Felix Herrmann, k0ral,
David Keijser, Jake Probst, and Gregor Uhlenheuer. Any breakages are my fault
:).
