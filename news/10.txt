2 Months of hacking (working).  A status update.

2009-06-21

Depending on who you ask, you'll get various opinions on the state and
usability of uzbl.  Some people are already using it full-time, others are
waiting for (or hacking on) one or two specific features they really want.
For me personally, what I still consider must-haves that are not finished
yet:
- better (faster) way of doing cookies, using one process instead of forking expensive python scripts all the time. (this is being worked on)
- a good instance management script that considers tag/name/page state etc.

Others seem to want:
- DOM access from C ~ better link following. (this is being worked on)
- greasemonkey and fancier JS extensions. (this is being worked on)
- a slightly more versatile configuration language (being worked on)
- refactoring keyboard shortcut interface


But other then that, yeah uzbl is pretty usable.

Also, I don't know about you but I just love (random) statistics so here you
go:
- peak amount of people on IRC: 83
- project followers on github: 95
- mailing list messages: 101
- commits (experimental): 1123
- lines of C code: 3198 (I hope this doesn't rise too much anymore)
- lines of code in sample scripts: 1341
- contributors: 27 (including myself)
- website visits: 33.600 (12.681 on may 26th, the day we were on HackerNews)

Furthermore, it seems like the <a href="/wiki">wiki</a> also started flourishing:
The <a href="/wiki/howtos">howtos</a> section lists tutorials for Gentoo, Debian, Ubuntu, PLD, MacOSX and NixOS.
And on the <a href="/wiki/scripts">scripts</a> and <a href="/wiki/config">config</a> pages people are posting really cool stuff.

Dieter.
