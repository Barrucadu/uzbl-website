2010.11.25: Beware, I Live! (Now faster, more stable and more capable)

2010-11-25

Hey folks! Things have been quiet here for a while, but uzbl is still steadily
improving. In the last 3 months we have:

<ul>
  <li>fixed a bug that caused uzbl-tabbed to hog CPU time after closing a tab
  <li>introduced a C cookie daemon that uses a much faster algorithm than
      uzbl-cookie-daemon
  <li>fixed a crash when opening an image in a new window
  <li>fixed several memory leaks
  <li>added <code>SCROLL_VERT</code> and <code>SCROLL_HORIZ</code> events, which
      allow us to display the scroll percentage in the status bar again
  <li>added the <code>show_inspector</code> command to show the Web Inspector
  <li>added the <code>enable_pagecache</code> variable to enable the <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/427/webkit-page-cache-i-the-basics/">Webkit Page Cache</a>
  <li>added some new default keybindings
  <li>refactored the default shell scripts to share code
  <li>and fixed and tidied lots of other little things
</ul>
Thanks to Ben Boeckel, Michael Raskin, Daiki Ueno, Lars-Dominik Braun and
Pawe≈Ç Zuzelski for these patches, and for keeping development active! (Thanks
also to those whose patches still need to be merged, I'll be getting to those
too.)

There's still a lot that all of us can do to help make uzbl better, and a lot of
cool things that uzbl can do for us. I'm looking forward to seeing what people
come up with!
