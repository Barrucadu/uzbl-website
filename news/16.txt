2009.09.12: many refactorings, fixes and improvements

2009-09-12

- uzbl: deprecate the history_handler variable.  The script stays, but you can bind to load_finish_handler. (Tom Adams)
- uzbl: more sensible (better performing) max_conns and max_conns_host (me)
- uzbl: don't hardcode keycmd clearing on load_start and make it optional (Tom Adams)
- uzbl: always_insert_mode fix (James S Wheaton)
- cookie_daemon.py: domain whitelisting (Michael Fiano)
- cookie_daemon.py: initscript-like {start|stop|restart|reload} commands (Mason Larobina)
- cookie_daemon.py: prevent duplicate daemons (Mason Larobina)
- uzbl_tabbed: multiline tablist (Jake Probst)
- uzbl_tabbed: bring_to_front (Devon Jones)
- Makefile: /usr/local prefix by default (Tom Adams)
- configs: don't put things like hostname in default user-agent (me)
- various code cleanups and improvements
- deprecate uzblctrl in favor of the more generic <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/socat/">socat</a> tool. (Tom Adams)

In the meanwhile, the event-messages branch has been moved into experimental.
The diff is huge, it's still a work in progress but everyone clearly agrees that this is "the future".  
It will bring many improvements, such as binding of special keys, a good implementation of Modkeys
and finegrained event handling in whichever (scripting) language you want.
